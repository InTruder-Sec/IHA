# Iconic Hashing Algorithm
IH is a unique hashing algorithm which works on base 10 digits for hashing.  This hashing algorithm works on each of these digits to convert them into an unpredictable number format. The overall size of the hash is 38, 6 greater than the size of MD5 Hashing algorithm. The algorithm is designed such that operations made on the digits is almost impossible to reverse, and its really hard even for a machine to reverse it using all the possible digits.  Each of letters, numbers, symbol, and even different number of spaces have different number of spaces. 

# Usage
3.6 | Usage
The algorithm is easy to use and is very user friendly. When a user runs a code in python language it asks user to input a string. This string is latter hashed by the algorithm. User just has to input the string which he has to hash.
